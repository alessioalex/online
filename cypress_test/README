Cypress based test framework for LibreOffice Online
====================================================

Running tests
------------------

All tests are part of the make check build. So you can
just execute it from the root folder of online repository.

    make check

To run only cypress test cases, you need to start loolwsd
server first. To do that you can call make run on a separate
command line window, so LibreOffice online is started.

After the server is running you can execute the test,
calling the given run command. You need to run the
command under cypress_test\ folder.

To run all cypress tests:

    npm run cyrun

To run all desktop tests:

    npm run cyrun_desktop

To run all mobile tests:

    npm run cyrun_mobile

To run one specific test suit of desktop tests:

    npm run cyrun_desktop --spec example_desktop_test_spec.js

To run one specific test suit of mobile tests:

    npm run cyrun_mobile --spec toolbar_spec.js

You can also open cypress tests in the browser, so you can
check what happens during test run. It's useful for writing
new tests or checking why an existing test fails.

To open desktop tests in browser:

    npm run cyopen_desktop

To open mobile tests in browser:

    npm run cyopen_mobile

During the build we run the tests with Chrome browser, so make sure
you select Chrome browser on the GUI while checking tests.
