Cypress based test framework for LibreOffice Online
====================================================

Running tests
------------------

All tests are part of the make check build. So you can
just execute it in the top folder.

    make check

To run only cypress test cases, you need to start loolwsd
server first and then run the given cyrun command.
To run all cypress tests:

    make run &
    cd cypress
    npm run cyrun

To run all desktop tests:

    cd cypress
    npm run cyrun_desktop

To run all mobile tests:

    cd cypress
    npm run cyrun_mobile

You can also open cypress tests in the browser, so you can
check what happens during test run. It's useful for writing
new tests or checking why an existing test fails.

To open desktop tests in browser:

    cd cypress
    npm run cyopen_desktop

To open mobile tests in browser:

    cd cypress
    npm run cyopen_mobile
